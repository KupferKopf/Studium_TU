# Denki
Denki aka Denkweisen der Informatik was also in the 1. Semester
containing mainly the theory of different ways of thinking about a problem or a situtation.
Depending on the problem or the solution one wants a different way of thinking might be required

In the first mini-projekt we had to work on in a two-people-team we had Scientific Thinking and Computational Thinking 
The description was something along the lines: "create a 1000 digit long number and look if the beginning 3, 4 or 5 or so digits repeat in the same order at some other point in the number, if they do we have a timeloop, if the don't there is no time loop"

we had to do this in 5 programming languages that we havent heared anything about bevor and chose:
- ELAN
- Lua
- Pascal
- Perl
- Ruby
- Smalltalk

(note: one had to be older then 1974, i can tell you old languages are *special*, it was interesting trying to this)

finding working compilers for the old ones was truly a pain
