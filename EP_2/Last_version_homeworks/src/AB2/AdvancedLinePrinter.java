 * The AdvancedLinePrinter class is designed to render Braille text representations to standard output
 * using an auto-scaling memory efficient line buffer and a customizable font.
 *
 * <p>This class provides methods for printing Braille characters and strings, both specified by corresponding
 * ASCII characters. All print operations at character level are delegated to the line buffer.</p>
 * <p>The line buffer can also be modified by inserting and deleting characters at specified positions.
 * It can be sent to the system's standard output (console) at any time by calling the {@code flush()} method,
 * which also clears the line buffer.</p>
